                Unseen is a service to detect, notify and deal with antisocial
                behaviour (ASB) on public transport. This was a project
                developed in response to a brief from "Accenture The Dock" to
                improve urban citizens' transportation experiences.

        <h5>Research</h5>
        <p>
          The aim of the research phase was to identify issues with transport in
          the city. To identify areas for improvement, we conducted:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Surveys</li>
          <li>Interviews</li>
          <li>Ethnographic Studies</li>
          <li>Secondary Research</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="unseen-research-box">
          <div class="unseen-background-box"></div>
          <h5>Interviews</h5>
          <div class="flex-box">
            <div>
              <p>
                Through more than 20 interviews, we gained valuable information
                about how city inhabitants use transportation and the challenges
                they encounter. The following quotes are some we heard;
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <blockquote>
                “I always feel a bit on edge on public transport”
              </blockquote>
              <br />
              <br />
              <blockquote>
                “My kids use the LUAS and you should hear the stories they be
                telling me”
              </blockquote>

            </div>
          </div>
          <h5>Surveys</h5>
          <div class="survey-box">
            <p>
              We received a substantial number of comments and stories
              concerning anti-social behaviour in the hundreds of replies to the
              multiple surveys we distributed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We spoke with various persons who had informed us about antisocial
              behaviour since so many people had commented on it previously. We
              acquired data for our problem statement from these interviews.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <blockquote>
              "I just look out the window to stay out of the situation"
            </blockquote>
            <br /><br />
            <blockquote>"Sure the driver does nothing"</blockquote>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              In Dublin, according to our surveys, about 90% of people have
              observed antisocial behaviour on public transportation, but less
              than 10% have reported it.

        <h5>Defining the Problem</h5>
        <p>
          The common themes that emerged from our research synthesis provided
          justification for investigating the issue of
          <strong>antisocial behaviour on public transportation.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedures for reporting antisocial behaviour were perceived by
          users of public transportation to be insufficient and largely useless,
          according to our interviews.  This presented us with an opportunity to
          develop a system for reporting and dealing with antisocial behaviour.

      <section id="unseen-user-needs">
        <h5>User Needs</h5>
        <p>
          To help us identify the users for whom we were seeking to find a
          solution, we developed user personas. These included the driver,
          passengers waiting for the vehicle, individuals using public
          transportation, and emergency service personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
          From interviews with people from each role of our personas we outlined
          what each user needed from our service:

              System Blueprint
            </h5>
            <p>
              Our design stage began with iterating on a system blueprint, which
              we altered with the help of public transport drivers who knew the
              current systems in place better than we did.

        <h5 style="color: var(--secondary-accent-color)">Detecting ASB</h5>
        <p>
          We designed an application, a sensor module to detect antisocial
          behaviour and a notification system to confirm the detection of
          antisocial behaviour, which would work together to both detect and
          solve antisocial behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sensor would detect noise levels and speech in transport, which
          would use an onboard AI to determine if there could be Antisocial
          Behaviour.

        />
        <h5 style="color: var(--secondary-accent-color)">The App</h5>
        <p>
          If ASB was detected by the sensor, people on that vehicle would be
          prompted to report the behaviour through a notification from the app.

              <h5>Reporting Flow</h5>
              <p>
                If people confirm there is ASB onboard the vehicle, the app
                brings to user to fill our the reporting flow, which takes less
                than a minute to complete, and is completely anonymous. The
                features of it being quick, discreet and anonymous was important
                due to this quote we got from an interviewee regrading reporting
                ASB:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                “There would be consequences & I might get attacked”

            <h5>Being Kept in the Loop</h5>
            <p>
              After reporting the ASB the emergency services will be notified of
              the location and ASB type, and the reporter will be kept up to
              date with how to situation is being handled. Keeping the user
              in-the-know with continuous feedback was a key touchpoint of our
              interviews on what users wish they had.

          After ASB has been reported or detected, people waiting on that

          to take this vehicle.

        <p>
          In conclusion, the service prototype received positive feedback from
          both public transport users and public transport employees.
        </p>
        <p>The service has predicted benefits of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making people feel safer on public transport</li>
          <li>Reduce Emergency service response time</li>
          <li>Encourage reporting ASB</li>
          <li>
            Increase amount of usage of public transport due to addressed safety
            concerns
          </li>
          <li>
            Less money spent by transport stakeholders on private security
