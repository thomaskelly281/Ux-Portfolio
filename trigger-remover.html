        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
          The initial stages of this project started as an exploration into how
          users with mental health issues experienced the web and how this
          experience could be improved upon.
          <br />
          <br />
          I interviewed a 19 year old, female, paranoid schizophrenic
          <span class="intext-span">(let’s call her Janet)</span>, to gain
          better insight into how someone with a mental disorder uses the web
          and how their disorder affects their experience. Janet referred to an
          instance where she saw an image of a monster online and then had the
          monster reappear in her room as a hallucination during a following
          schizophrenic episode.
          <br />
          <br />
          After my interview with Janet, I interviewed a psychologist
          <span class="intext-span">(let's call them Alex)</span>. I asked Alex
          about their knowledge of people with mental health disorders using the
          internet. They explained to me how...
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="purple-box">
          <blockquote>
            “...the internet is full of triggers, and apps and sites, such as
            most social media, can be dangerous or have negative implications
            for people who may be vulnerable to specific content.”
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          With the information given to me by Janet and Alex, I defined the
          problem and decided upon a concept;
        </p>
        <br />

        <div class="purple-box">
          <p>
            <span class="intext-span">Problem:</span> Triggering content on the
            web.

      <section id="tr-research" class="expanded">
        <h5>Research</h5>
        <p>
          After defining the problem of triggering content, I began researching
          triggers. I learned that a trigger is a psychological stimulus that
          could be anything from a smell, sound or sight that reminds the person
          of a feeling of trauma
          <span class="intext-span"
            >(Trigger - GoodTherapy.org Therapy Blog, 2022)</span
          >.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another point I read was that thinking of a trigger could be enough of
          a trigger itself to cause a response. In the same study, it was shown
          that people are too good at word association to see a trigger warning
          and not think of the triggers they would be stimulated by
          <span class="intext-span">(Nast, 2022)</span>. This suggested to me
          that there was a possibility for not just warning people about
          triggers, but, for deleting triggers.
          <br />
          <br />
          One interesting project I found was by student staff at PARC
          <span class="intext-span"
            >(Prevention, Advocacy & Resource Center)</span
          >, Brandeis University. The project was a collection of words and
          phrases which have negative connotations, violent histories or be
          triggering. The project entitled “Suggested Language List” was to
          educate people on how the language they use could do harm and how they
          can accommodate for this
          <span class="intext-span">(PARC, 2022)</span>.

        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <p>
          Crazy Eights with the prompt of “smart trigger warning” led the
          ideation phase.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ideas of removing named triggers from webpages, removing search
          results containing triggers and a trigger handling system were all
          ideas which had some merit in pursuing and further development.
          <br />
          <br />
          I expanded the idea's scope and details, and then merged them into one
          larger concept.

        <h5>The Idea</h5>
        <p>
          After merging the three concepts from the ideation phase the concept
          of having users input their triggers into a form, and then having an
          AI image and text recognition algorithm remove content containing the
          user's triggers from webpages was generated.

      <section id="tr-before-prototyping" class="expanded">
        <h5>Before Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          In preparation for building the first prototype, I ideated multiple
          methods of covering, disguising and hiding triggers.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/Images/trigger-hiding-img-min.jpg"
          alt="Examples of methods I was considering useing to hide text"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <p>
          Also, I defined levels of trigger removal depending on the severity of
          the triggering content. This allows for the user to have more choice
          in what they choose to see and the knowledge that some content may
          affect them less than other content on the page.
        </p>

          src="/Images/types-of-cover-img.jpg"
          alt="5 levels of trigger severity and how they would be handled by the Trigger Remover"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <p>
          The web also contains multiple types of content, from text to images,
          to videos. I decided to design trigger removal/censoring methods for
          each, to ensure all bases were covered and so the user wouldn’t be
          caught off guard while thinking they were having a safer browsing
          experience, resulting in the user finding an edge case.

      <section id="tr-how-testing-was-conducted" class="expanded">
        <h5>How Testing Was Conducted</h5>
        <p>
          For testing the prototype, I wanted qualitative and quantitative data,
          to enforce the user feedback given during and after the prototype. The
          testing consisted of moderated usability studies so the facilitator
          (me) could make note of the body language the user makes as well as
          ask the user questions. The test ended with a series of questions
          about the user’s experience, how they found the interactions and their
          opinion on the levels of triggering content. I gathered quantitive
          data using Emojify, an AI emotion tracker where the user’s facial
          expressions would give us insight into how they feel about specific
          content <span class="intext-span">(Emojify, 2022)</span>.

          alt="User demonstrating prototype using Emojify to detect their emotional state"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <p>
          Before the prototype began, a disclaimer was given to each tester that
          they would be seeing trigger and sensitive content, so they were may
          aware they could stop, take a break at any time or not look at any
          content if they didn’t want to. For each prototype 7 testing
          participants were used each from varying age ranges and with different
          mental health disorders
          <span class="intext-span"
            >(for their privacy I will not be using any further information
            about the participants)</span

      <section id="tr-prototype-1">
        <h5>Prototype & Testing - Round 1</h5>
        <p>
          The first prototype was made using a news article containing some
          graphic content. The graphic content was then covered using different
          levels of resistance. Using Emojify I got a baseline of 30.2% of the
          time reading the graphic content that participants were nervous.

              In the early stages of concept development, interviewing people
              with experience and industry professionals can be extremely
              beneficial to make sure the project goes in the right direction.

              Using facial emotion recognition was an effective method of
              gathering quantitive data to justify design decisions and
              effectiveness. In future, I would consider including additional
              methods of gathering quantitative data, such as using Hotjar in
              unison with other methods.

          To ensure that the designs I created are viable and possible to build,
          I made sure to find methods in which they could be created, most
          possibly as a first iteration.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="heading-span">Image Blurring:</span> For the image
          bluring trigger cover, I found ImageMagik, a function of the Google
          Cloud which allows for image blurring. Google Cloud also include
          documentation on how to set this up using the Google Cloud API, in
          languages such as Node.JS, Python or Java.
          <span class="intext-span"
            >(My recommendation would be using Node.JS as the other proof of
            concepts coming up use vanilla JS and JSON). (Google Cloud,
            2022)</span

        />
        <p>
          <span class="heading-span">Triggering Content Recognition:</span> In
          order for triggers in images to be covered some form of image
          recognition is needed that can also recognise if the content is
          triggering. The Google Cloud Vision API contains a ‘Safe Search’
          function which recognises any potentially unwanted properties or
          objects in images, in our case, triggers.<span class="intext-span">
            (Google Cloud, 2022)</span

        <img
          src="/Images/image-recognition-img-min.jpg"
          alt="Google Cloud image object recognition page, displaying that no graphic content can be seen in image"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <p>
          <span class="heading-span">Paraphrasing Tool:</span> To remove the
          lowest level of trigger in the prototype, words that could be
          triggering but aren’t guaranteed to have an effect were altered to
          other synonyms. To do this on a site you would need access to a
          paraphrasing tool. I found multiple open-source paraphrasers on
          GitHub.

        />
        <p>
          <span class="heading-span">Removing Search Results:</span> Removing
          triggers from search results completely is the easiest to accomplish
          of each of these tasks. Dorking is a method of searching the web with
          more specificity. If you injected the trigger with a minus sign in
          front of it <span class="intext-span">(-trigger)</span>, no search
          results containing that trigger will be displayed.
