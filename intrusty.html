              gain LinkedIn skill endorsements.

          Familiarising ourselves with features, proposition values and

            Lecturers felt the need for more integration with tools such as
            Google Classroom, as they wouldn’t want to have to add each student
            to a class individually.

            Giving grades was not a favourable method of providing students with

          A final service blueprint displayed how a user would experience the

          Our final design allowed students to upload any form of work or
          projects to the service, where lecturers and industry professionals
          are rewarded after giving valuable feedback, creating an ecosystem of
          asking for and receiving feedback. This solves Han’s initial problem
          of not having a place to ask for unbiased and useful feedback.
