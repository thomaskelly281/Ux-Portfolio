                 <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas <i>(he/him)</i>.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                  I am a UX designer and Interaction design specialist focussed on designing future technologies, such as AI, VR and other creative technologies.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Currently, I am studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Interaction Design at the <a>National College of Art & Design</a> <abbr>(NCAD)</abbr>, Dublin. During the course of my degree, I have gained experience in the UX design process, from research methods, such as user interviews and usability tests to product development, such as programming and prototyping.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 In May 2021, I graduated the <a>Google UX Design Professional Certificate</a> where I refined UX and IxD practices as well as getting an insight into how the UX design process is implimented and what techniques are favoured in certain situations in an industry settings.
